Introduction of js: 
-it is use to add functionality into webpage or webapp 
-it is loosly typed language.
-it is scripting language 

*there are two ways to use js 
1.intrnal js: it this we write script tag in html page  
2.external js: in this we create a seperate javacript.

Note:- in js window is global onject 

*How to get output in javascript
1.document.write(); => it will display output at bottom of browser.
2.window.alert(); => it will display output in popup window.
3.console.log();=> it will display output in browser console.
4.DOM(Document Object Model)
-how to set value 
-how to get value 
-how to apply style property.

*what is variable 
-it is use to store data in it.
-in in js we can create a variable with var, let,const.

var variableName;

*rules for creating variable
-variable name can not start with number.
-it can not be any reserved keyword.
-variableName can start with alphabet,_ or $ ;
-variableName start with lowercase letter.

*Why js is called as loosley typed language 
-when we create a variable in javascript we can not determine what type of data it contain,untill and unless we initialze it. 

*Data types 
*inbuilt data type 
1.number: 101,0.5,656265
2.string: "" or '' 
3.boolean: true or false 
4.null: null 
5.undefine  
6.symbol: @,$,# 

*user Define data type 
array:[] -it is use to store multiple values with same datatype
Object:{}

=============================================================
*Operators: to perform operation we use Operators 
1.Arithmatic Operators: +,-,*,/,%(modulus),** 
2.Assignment Operators(=)
-whatever value or data we have on right hand side that store in left hand side variable. 
var myName = "Rajani"
3.Logical Operators : Logical operator always return boolean value.
1. AND(&&),OR(||) ,NOT(!)

4.Relational Operator 
<,<= , > ,>= 
5.comparision operator 
1. == : it will check only value not data type and if value are equall then it return true.
2. === :it will check value as well as its data type and if both are same then an only then it return true.

Note: in js + operator is use to perform two operation 
    1. to perform addition 
    2. to perform concationation 

*function :
-it is block of code which is use to perform specific task.
-it execute only when we call it.
-we can reuse it multiple time.
-In js we have mainly two type of function 
1.Inbuilt function :  function provide by js to us 
2.User define function : function create by us 

syntax:  function functionName(){
    //logical code 
}

-in user define function we have four types 
1.function with no parameter and no return type (default function)
2.function with parameter and no return type (parameterize function)
3.function with no parameter and with retun type.
4.function with parameter and with return type.
